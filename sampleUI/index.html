            <P style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" >Information Technology is a fascinating career field, equally challenging, relatively easy to get into, and for the right individual, it also can be quite lucrative. An overall consensus is, in America, there is a critical shortage of qualified, professional, and skilled talent (UniXL, n.d.) This document will highlight several opportunities available to Information Technology professionals.
                In all industries, IT personnel are in demand and employers are willing to pay for top notch professionals. Some positions require some college, others require certifications and still others require a degree. Hiring areas such as the federal, government, academic and corporate positions will illustrate potential employers, preparation and hiring criteria. In addition, an exploration of academic and projected salary information will assist a potential employee desiring to specialize in the Information Technology field. (U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2010)

                Federal jobs can be found within Homeland Security, Smithsonian Institution, Army, Navy, Air Force and the Department of Defense. IT remains a critical aspect of government work in all industries and sectors, as well as an industry in its own right. However, America continues to suffer from a shortage of qualified IT workers with flexible and portable skills who can readily adapt and respond to ever-changing IT demands and processes. If you do decide to specialize in technology, you should understand the technical qualifications you will have to meet for each job you apply to. (Stone, 2010)
                For all IT-related occupations, technical and professional certifications are growing more popular and increasingly important. IT workers must continually update and acquire new skills to remain qualified in this dynamic field. Completion of vocational training also is an asset. According to a May 2000 report by the Urban Institute, community colleges play a critical role in training new workers and in retraining both veteran workers and workers from other fields.
